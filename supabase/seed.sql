-- Insert sample entries (you'll need to replace the created_by UUID with an actual user ID after first login)
-- This is just a placeholder - entries will be created by admins after login

-- You can manually insert test data after getting a user ID:
-- INSERT INTO entries (name, shape, color, created_by) VALUES
-- ('Circle Red', 'circle', '#FF0000', 'your-user-id-here'),
-- ('Square Blue', 'square', '#0000FF', 'your-user-id-here'),
-- ('Triangle Green', 'triangle', '#00FF00', 'your-user-id-here');
